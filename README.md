## **DESCRIPTION**

A simple easy-to-use application so people can run Offline Echo VR easily, with built in presets and easy to use custom builder without you having to manually close Echo VR or type in behaviours.
This project has been discontinued due to the release of [EchoRelay](https://github.com/Xenomega/EchoRelay). Some still find they have to launch EchoVR with arguments, therefore this tool still being fairly useful.

## **FEATURES**

* Automatically closes Echo VR and re-opens
* Launch your game in under 5 seconds
* Built in presets including 3v3 Bots, Private, Social Lobby
* Custom builder using the dropdown menu, you only have to select the level and gametype
* Automatically runs behaviours for you so you don't have to type them yourself
